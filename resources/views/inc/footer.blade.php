In its simplest form, It is concerned with people trying to access remote services that they are not authorized to use. Most security problems are intentionally caused by malicious people trying to gain some benefit, get attention, or to harm someone. Network security problems can be divided roughly into four closely intertwined areas: secrecy, authentication, non-repudiation, and integrity control. Secrecy, also called confidentiality, has to do with keeping information out of the hands of unauthorized users. Authentication deals with determining whom you are talking to before revealing sensitive information or entering into a business deal. 
                                    Non repudiation deals with signatures. The degree of accidence of an organization that service to customer such bank security depend on speed and accuracy with the performed in the bank which include information processing.
